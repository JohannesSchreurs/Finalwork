            <p>This experience was made for my Final Work assignment.</p>
            <p>The goal was to create a visual environment for a song and spoken text by Godspeed You! Black Emperor.</p>
            <p>If you are on a mobile network, it is not recommended to proceed, as a lot of data will be downloaded.</p>
            <p>Make sure to turn the sound on.</p>
            <p>Best results are with a headphone, a Google Cardboard and in landscape mode.</p>
            <p>If you have a Google Cardboard, press the Google Cardboard logo in the right bottom corner while the experience is playing.</p>
